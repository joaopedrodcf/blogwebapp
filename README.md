# blogwebapp
Will use this project to build a rest webapp that can be deployd in a tomcat and then be used by some client to get information from a mysql database.

# Lombok
This project uses lombok and because of that you need to install lombok in your eclipse, the way I have done it was just maven install this project.
After that went into - C:\Users\<YOUR USER>\.m2\repository\org\projectlombok\lombok\1.16.20
Just double click the lombok jar and click install in your eclipse.
