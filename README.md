# blogwebapp
Will use this project to build a rest webapp that can be deployd in a tomcat and then be used by some client to get information from a mysql database.

# Lombok
This project uses lombok and because of that you need to install lombok
The way I do it is just maven install this project then go into this DIR
C:\Users\<YOUR USER>\.m2\repository\org\projectlombok\lombok\1.16.20
After this you just need to double click the lombok jar and click install in your eclipse
